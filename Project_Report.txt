PROJECT REPORT: RT-CHAT APPLICATION
=========================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
RT-CHAT is a multi-threaded, real-time chat application built using Java. It features a modern, responsive User Interface (UI) with distinct support for private messaging and global announcements. The application is designed for efficiency and ease of use, with a codebase optimized for minimal footprint while maintaining robust functionality.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
-------------------
*   Language: Java (JDK 8+)
*   GUI Framework: Swing & AWT (javax.swing, java.awt)
*   Networking: Java Socket API (java.net) for TCP/IP communication
*   I/O: Java IO (java.io) for stream handling
*   Concurrency: Java Threading for handling multiple client connections simultaneously.

3. ARCHITECTURE & MODULES
-------------------------
The project follows a standard Client-Server architecture.

A. ChatServer.java (The Server)
   - Purpose: Acts as the central hub for the application.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Listens on a specific port (default: 12345) for incoming connection requests.
     - Maintains a registry of active users and their output streams.
     - Spawns a new `ClientHandler` thread for each connected user.
     - Manages broadcasting of user presence (JOIN/LEFT messages).

B. ClientHandler.java (Connection Manager)
   - Purpose: Manages the persistent connection for a single connected client.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Reads incoming messages from the specific client.
     - Routes messages:
       - "PM:Target:Msg": Directs private messages to a specific user.
       - Standard Message: Broadcasts global announcements to all users.
     - Handles client disconnection cleanup.

C. ChatClient.java (The Client & UI)
   - Purpose: The user-facing application for sending/receiving messages.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Networking: Connects to the server, sends messages, and listens for incoming data in a background thread.
     - UI Rendering:
       - Login Dialog: Captures Name, Server IP, and Port.
       - Contact List: Dynamic list with "Live" updates, Avatars, and Unread Counters.
       - Chat Area: CardLayout-based view for switching between chats.
       - Custom Components: 'Bubble' for messages, 'ContactRenderer' for the list styling.
     - Features Logic:
       - Dark/Light Mode toggle.
       - Emoji Picker interaction.
       - Unread message tracking (Map<String, Integer>).

4. KEY FUNCTIONALITIES
----------------------
1.  **Authentication**: Users can define a Display Name, Server IP, and Port to connect.
2.  **Global Announcements**: A pinned "📢 Announcements" channel allows users to broadcast messages to everyone on the server.
3.  **Private Messaging**: Secure one-on-one communication. Clicking a user in the list opens a private channel.
4.  **Modern UI/UX**:
    -   **Dark Mode**: Fully themed dark interface with a toggle switch.
    -   **Emoji Picker**: Integrated popup menu for inserting emojis.
    -   **Rich Chat Bubbles**: Messages appear in styled bubbles with timestamps (HH:mm).
    -   **Avatars**: Generated initials on colorful backgrounds for users.
5.  **Unread Notifications**: Visual red indicators `[N]` next to contact names show the number of unread messages.
6.  **Responsive Feedback**: 
    -   Auto-scrolling to the latest message.
    -   Real-time updates when users join or leave.

5. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
-------------------------
The app uses a simple string-based text protocol:
-   `NAME:User` -> Handshake.
-   `PM:Target:Message` -> Private Message.
-   `MSG:Sender:Message` -> Global Message (Broadcast).
-   `JOIN:User` / `LEFT:User` -> Presence updates.
